<p>It's always a bad practise to ignore an exception. The worst case is to throw an new exception without preservation of original stack trace, since you can never know the root cause when the exception is thrown.</p>
<p>If you do have nothing to do with the exception, just log it with <code>LOG.warn()</code></p>
