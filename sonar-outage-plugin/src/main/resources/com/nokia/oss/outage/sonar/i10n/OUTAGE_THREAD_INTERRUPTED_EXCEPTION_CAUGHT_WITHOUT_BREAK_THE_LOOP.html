<p>Interruption is a cooperative mechanism between threads. When an <code>InterruptedException</code> is thrown, that means something important happens, your code need to drop it's current task. </p>
<p>For example, when a thread pool is shutting down, it will interrupt all threads in the pool. </p>
<p>If one of the thread is executing the while loop, then your code should break the loop and exit, other wise the thread pool will failed to shutdown</p>
