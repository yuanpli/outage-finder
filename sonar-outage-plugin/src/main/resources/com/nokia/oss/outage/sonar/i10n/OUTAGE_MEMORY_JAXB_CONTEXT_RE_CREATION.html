<p>The <code>javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext</code> is created and assigned to a local variable.</p>
<p>
    JAXB has a default optimization for data binding, which will generate extra classes for each field even if you
    already have getter/setter in your own class.
    Those generated classes have a naming pattern as:
    <code>{your_own_class_name}$JaxbAccessorF_{your_field_name}</code>
    The problem is every time when the JAXBContext is created, those classes are re-generated and loaded into the class
    loader. If you do this in the method, then
    you will get and PermGen/Meta space OOM sooner or later. This can be observed by check your application class
    loader.

Important: JAX-WS has the same problem since it use JAXB for data binding.

<p>
    In practise, re-use JAXBContext since it is thread safe, but create new Marshaller/UnMarshaller in every call.
